This is the `zen` theme modified to use icons from the [ForkAwesome](https://forkawesome.github.io) project instead of the originally used [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io) icons. Note that icon names and classes are different.

The zen and zen-based themes are very customizable, so to make these themes work, you have to use the sample config file.

Enjoy!

**WARNING:** The themes use Less for their styles, but you don't need a Less compiler installed to use it.
